Manchester United fans should look upon this season as an opportunity.

It sounds horribly patronising, doesn't it? The sort of advice that might
be imparted with a soppy smile, a ruffle of the hair and a tweak of the
cheeks.

For United fan Ray, who went viral on the internet last week with a full-
frontal video attack on beleaguered manager David Moyes,  this season has
been less an opportunity than a series of bloody nightmares.

"He [Moyes] has ripped the heart out of the team, he's ripped the soul out
of it, he's ripped the passion out of it," said Ray following United's 3-0
defeat by Liverpool. Ray's overall assessment of Moyes's tactics?
"Bobbins."

If United get thumped by cross-town rivals Manchester City at Old Trafford
on Tuesday, Ray might end up becoming a fuming blob on his expensive seat,
having spontaneously combusted.

But for others, the Reds' disappointing form this season is a chance to re-
evaluate and remind those fellow supporters who have grown cosily
accustomed to winning over the last 25 years what it is to be an authentic
football fan.

"A lot of the younger supporters have known nothing but success," says Sean
Bones, vice-chairman of the Manchester United Supporters' Trust.  "It's
become part of our identity, part of our ego. They have certain
expectations and when the team doesn't live up to those expectations,
people get upset.
